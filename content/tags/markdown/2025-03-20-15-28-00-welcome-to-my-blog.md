# Welcome to My Blog!

This is a sample blog post to demonstrate how the blog works. This blog is built with React and Vite, and uses markdown files for content.

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write your posts in markdown format
- **Tag System**: Organize your posts with tags
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices
- **Fast Performance**: Built with Vite for optimal performance

## Code Example

```javascript
// Example of a React component
function HelloWorld() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my blog!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## How to Create a New Post

To create a new post, run the following command:

```bash
npm run new-post
```

This will prompt you for a title and tags, and create a new markdown file with the current date and time.

## Conclusion

Thanks for checking out my blog! I hope you enjoy reading my posts.
